# HB24: Humblebragging Detection

This is the official repository for our paper:  
**“My life is miserable, have to sign 500 autographs everyday”: Exposing Humblebragging, the Brags in Disguise**  
Accepted at **Findings of ACL 2025**

We introduce the novel task of **humblebragging detection**, where self-promotion is masked as modesty or complaint. This work formalizes humblebragging using a 4-tuple structure, proposes a new dataset (HB24), and benchmarks a variety of machine learning and language models, including fine-tuned LLaMA.

This repository includes:
- Prompt templates used to generate synthetic humblebrags
- The HB24 dataset
- Fine-tuning code for LLaMA-based models on humblebrag detection

## Note

The current version of the repository includes **only the non-humblebrag examples** in the test set. Due to copyright restrictions, we are unable to release the humblebrag test examples, which were curated from a book that is not publicly available.
